# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

**Development:**

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite development server with HMR
- `npm run build` - TypeScript build + Vite production build
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

**Code Quality:**

- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting with Prettier
- `npm run format` - Auto-format code with Prettier
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint checks
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript type checking
- `npm run all` - Run format, lint, typecheck, and test sequentially

**Testing:**

- `npm test` - Run BDD tests with Playwright
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests in Playwright UI mode

## Architecture

This is a React + TypeScript application using Vite as the build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Testing Setup (Playwright BDD)

The project uses Playwright with BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) for E2E testing:

- **Feature files:** `_features/*.feature` - Gherkin syntax test scenarios
- **Step definitions:** `test/steps/*.steps.ts` - TypeScript implementations using `createBdd()` from playwright-bdd
- **Generated tests:** `test/.gen/` - Auto-generated by `bddgen`, do not edit
- **Test reports:** `test/report/` (HTML), `test/results/` (artifacts)

Tests run against the Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173` (auto-started unless in CI).

### Code Style

- Prettier: no semicolons, single quotes, Tailwind class sorting
- ESLint: TypeScript-ESLint with React Hooks rules
